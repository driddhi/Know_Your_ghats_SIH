        <item> The ghat has a tall colonial structure, which is the landing berth of the ghat. It is a fine Doric-Greek style pavilion with huge pillars. The ghat, originally known was Baboo Raj Chandra Ghat, is now only known by first words Baboo-ghat or Babu-ghat. Babu / Baboo in Bengali means Sahib or gentleman. The ghat is named after Babu Raj Chandra Das, husband of Rani Rashmoni and zamindar of Janbazar, who built it in 1830, in memory of her late husband. A marble tablet beneath the pediment implies that some of the credit for the erection of the ghat must go to Lord William Bentinck as he encouraged such spending with a view to improve public amenities. It is second oldest ghat of Kolkata. Close to Eden Gardens and Netaji Indoor Stadium. Close to Calcutta High Court. Near Millenium Park.

        <item>The presence of sailors on the banks of the river is also associated with the culture of the river. They have a different culture on the waves of rivers. The role of Nishad Raj Guhaya in the story of crossing the Ganges to Lord Rama in the Treta Yuga and a unique example of his devotion, faith and devotion are still given today. The Nishad Ghat built on the banks of the Ganges, dedicated to the same society in Kashi, is also known as the Nishad Raj Ghat.
Before the year 1980, it used to be the uncovered raw part of Prahlad Ghat. Which in 1988, with the cooperation of the state government, the irrigation department gave a separate identity by constructing concrete. Due to the abundance of Nishad Mallah people in the Ghat area, it got its name as Nishad Raj Ghat. However the number of temples on the banks of the ghat is almost negligible. Although presently the ghat remains fixed, the devotees and local people visiting this ghat also take bath at Prahlada Ghat, which is known earlier. Although people also clean clothes etc. at this ghat. But due to the existence associated with Prahlad Ghat, it gets the same value. Also, this ghat is also included in various events related to Ganga.
Earlier it changed into a part of Prabhu Ghat till first half 20th century. Now a massive quantity of boatmen with their small boat and nets can be seen listen. Ghat has one Nishad raj Temple which in truth become constructed by way of boatmen families just a few year again. This Ghat has been built by the Municipal Corporation. Varanasi in the Ganges financial institution made numerous stunning ferries, those ferries are related in a few legendary or spiritual narrative.

Devotees are taking bathtub within the early morning to be unfastened from all the sins and prepare themselves for the Pooja. Sailor is pulling his boat to carry it on the financial institution that allows you to take pilgrims from one bank to the other. Pilgrims within the orange get dressed are taking their breakfast after the bathtub at the Gange ghat with a purpose to use their full day for seeing the attractive scenes. Some of them are taking tub and some of them are carrying cloth.

        <item>Rabindranath Tagore Rd, Near Sant Ravidas Mandir, Ghats of varanasi, Ghasi Tola, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh 221001</item>
        <item>This Ghat is one of the least commercialised ghats.... mostly used by local people for daily chores...good place to sit and relax.
Situated near to Kashi railway station, this is one of the famous ghats of Varanasi. This is next to Raj Ghat bridge. Famous Ravidas temple is located on this ghat. It is also famous for pind daan and asthi-visarjan. Famous priests of Kashi are based here. The ghats can easily be accessed through any kind of vehicles and parking facilities are also available here. This ghat is also friendly for disabled people who can not walk through narrow lanes of Kashi. They can easily reach here by car or bike.
The ghat was transformed with levelling and some built structure by means of Rajirao Balaji in ca 1720. This changed into rebuilt with stone slabs by way of Amrit Rao Peshva for the duration of 1780-1807, who changed into living in Banaras as exiled via the British government. Amrit Rao has also constructed the four temples of Amriteshvara,  Vinayakeshvara, Narayaneshvara and Gangeshvara, and four auxiliary shrines, and additionally renovated the Prabhasha Tirtha in 1780.
Earlier the ghat turned into called Amritarao Ghat as referred via James Prinsep and Edwin Greeves, however this turned into described below the call of “Raja Ghat” by way of Motichand. The northern aspect is the palace, and the southern element is the Annapurna Math. These sections are divided via the stairway. Till 1980 there was a culture to feed Brahmins, Sanskrit college students, ascetics, etc.
But whilst the Intach commenced its programme and the Clarks Hotel took initiated to use it for promoting a special group of tourists, the earlier traditions vanished. In 1965 the Government of Uttar Pradesh has renovated this ghat and built the stairs made of purple stones. At the principle front location, a refectory is constructed that completely reserved for the Brahmins.

        <item>Well maintained and well decorated ghat. Ferries are available for a ride across river Ganga. Well maintained sitting arrangement and bathing arrangement for tourist. The place is well connected with main road but vehicles is not permitted as connecting roads with main road is too narrow.
The matter is in the year 1988 when the irrigation department in collaboration with the state government built another Ganga Ghat. Earlier this ghat was raw and used to be a part of Rajghat itself. Even earlier, in 1937, a huge building named Janaki Kunj was built on top of the ghat by Rani Muniya Sahiba of Itauja, Lucknow. After which this ghat became known as Rani Ghat. At present the ghat is firm but due to lack of special religious importance, the bathing work here is relatively less than all other ghats. Therefore, there is a large gathering of cloth cleaners at the ghat. However, the order of special and other events related to Ganga at the Ghat continues.

        <item>The correct name was Shuka Ghat but by the time of disrespect, it became Sakka Ghat. In 1988, with the cooperation of the state government, the irrigation department built a concrete building on the ghat, which gave it an important charm and identity. The Ghats are mentioned by James the British historian James Prinsep in a citation in 1822. While Wax, who was almost his contemporary, discussed it in the year 1868 as Babu Suka Ghat. However, in the midst of all these naming discrepancies, it is popular today among the locals as Sakka Ghat. Sant Hardas Ram Sevashram is located in the upper part of the Ghat. Bal Chandreshwar Shiva temple is in its premises. At present, the ghats are firm, but due to the cleaning of the cloth by the dhobis, the arrival of the devotees and devotees to this ghat is also less. But all the major events related to Ganga are also held at this ghat.</item>

        <item>One of the city oldest ghats, this iconic site is a storied spot for traditional Hindu cremations. It is one of the oldest ghats in Varanasi. The Manikarnika Ghat is mentioned in a Gupta inscription of 5th century.[4] It is revered in Hindu religion. When Mata Sati (Aadi shakti mata) sacrificed her life and set her body ablaze after Raja Daksh Prajapati (one of the sons of Lord Brahma) tried to humiliate Lord Shiva in a Yagya practiced by Daksh. Lord Shiva took her burning body to the Himalaya. On seeing the unending sorrow of Lord Shiva, Vishnu sends the Divine chakra to cut the body into 51 parts which fall on earth. They are called "Ekannya Shaktipeeth". Lord Shiva established Shakti Peeth wherever Sati body had fallen. At Manikarnika ghat, Mata Sati Ear ornament had fallen.
To know that tourists come here to see the funeral pyres being set to fire in the open is more weird than fascinating. The routine ceremony starts when the dead body (wrapped in cloth) arrives and is carried on a bamboo stretcher with the chant ‘Ram naam satya hai’ echoing through the air. Next, the cost of cremation is calculated depending on the weight and type of the wood used. Sandalwood is the most expensive of all wood varieties available. The corpse is then dipped in the water of the River Ganges while the wood is stacked to build the pyre. Though photography is not allowed here, several tourists, especially foreigners, capture videos of the ghat or click pictures while on a boat tour of the city.
